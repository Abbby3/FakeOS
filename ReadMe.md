## Description

FakeOS is a web application that simulates an operating system interface. The project aims to help explore and consolidate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by replicating the layout and format of a given design. The application features a wallpaper that scales to fit the viewport, selectable icons, a menu, and a display for the current time. When an icon is selected, it will open an "app" in a modal, which can also be closed.
